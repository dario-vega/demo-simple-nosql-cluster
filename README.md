# Running Oracle NoSQL Database On Public Cloud (OCI, Azure, AWS)

The following [Quick Start white paper](https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/database/oracle-nosql-cluster-setup-oci.pdf) is designed 
as a reference guide for deploying the Oracle NoSQL Database on the OCI platform. 
> Read the APPENDIX A -RUNNING ORACLE NOSQLDATABASE ON OTHER CLOUDS

Scripts on https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/nosql-database-server-downloads.html

This script lets a user set up a small cluster (1-10 machines) quickly, for use in proof-of-concepts, small on premise installations, 
and cluster installations in cloud environments (OCI, AWS, Azure). It's easy to BYOL to the cloud environment of your choosing.

# Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service
[Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service](https://www.oracle.com/database/nosql-cloud.html) is a fully managed database cloud service that 
is designed for database operations that require predictable, single digit millisecond latency responses to simple queries. 
NoSQL Database Cloud Service allows developers to focus on application development rather than setting up cluster servers, 
or performing system monitoring, tuning, diagnosing, and scaling. 

# The demo-simple-nosql-cluster repository
**If you want to create an Oracle NoSQL Cluster, I recommend to use the official scripts above.** 

The scripts in this repository are for educational purpose and are my own.

In the development world, practice makes master. That is why you must find as many ways to practice as possible. 
Never stop learning.

## Prerequisites 

Just before start an Oracle NoSQL installation, I recommend to read those links
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/22.1/release-notes/overview.html
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/22.1/admin/installation-prerequisites.html

```
sudo yum install git
git clone https://github.com/dario-vega/demo-simple-nosql-cluster.git
```

### Open JDK

The client and server have been tested and certified against OpenJDK 11.0.2 (Oracle NoSQL 22.1 version). We encourage you to upgrade 
to the latest Java release to take advantage of the latest bug fixes and performance improvements. We expect to certify 
Oracle NoSQL Database with more recent Java versions in a future release.


I've tested with multiple Open JDK versions and it is working with all versions as documented.
```
sudo yum -y install java-8-openjdk-devel
sudo yum -y install java-11-openjdk-devel
sudo yum -y install java-13-openjdk-devel
sudo yum -y install java-latest-openjdk-devel
#donwload openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```
If it is not the case run the following command and send me the output
````
java -XshowSettings:properties 2>&1 | grep vendor
````

### Oracle JDK

The Oracle NoSQL Database server is compatible with Java SE 8 (64-bit), and the client is compatible with Java SE 8. 
Both the client and the server require at least Java SE 8, and should work with more recent Java SE versions

I've tested with multiple Oracle JDK versions and it is working with all versions as documented.

```
sudo yum install java
sudo yum install -y jdk1.8
# download the rmp 
sudo yum localinstall jdk-13.0.2_linux-x64_bin.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh jdk-14.0.2_linux-x64_bin.rpm

```
```
sudo alternatives --config java
```

FYI, In this demo, I will install our cluster using a jdk1.8 version in order to have access jps - Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool

## Download and unzip the binaries and exemples

Donwload the [Oracle NoSQL Database Servers](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/nosql-database-server-downloads.html)
- Community Edition : Oracle NoSQL Database Community Edition (CE) software is licensed pursuant to the Apache 2.0 License (Apache 2.0). 
- Enterprise Edition
- Oracle NoSQL Database Migrator

In this demo, we will use the Oracle NoSQL Database Servers - Enterprise Edition [Release 22.1](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/22.1/release-notes/index.html)

For more information about difference between versions and other topics, visit the [FAQ](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/nosqldb-learnmore-nosqldb-faq.html)

```
unzip kv-ee-22.1.16.zip -d nosql
unzip kv-examples-22.1.16.zip -d nosql
unzip nosql-migrator-1.3.0.zip
````

## Config & start agent 

Before you configure Oracle NoSQL Database, you should determine the parameters for each Storage Node in the store. 
Each of these parameters are directives to use with the makebootconfig utility, [see the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/22.1/admin/installation-configuration-parameters.html#GUID-9E2B0453-A0CF-4F34-8A82-A6D801D6C929)

1) Configue using the makebootconfig utility
2) Start the Oracle NoSQL Database Storage Node Agent (SNA)

In our case, we will use the following scripts [clean.sh](./script/clean.sh) and [boot.sh](./script/boot.sh) 

**TIP**: run jps to validate that nothing is running from a previous test. if it is the case, just kill the processes. (**NB** If you are not using Oracle JDK, use ps command)
````
[opc@node1-nosql ~]$ jps
9060 ManagedService
9017 kvstore.jar
14633 Jps
````
Run the commands clean.sh and boot.sh

### Useful script

Source the following env variables and alias
```
cat env.sh

export KVROOT=/home/opc/nosql/kvroot
export KVDATA=/home/opc/nosql/data
export KVHOME=/home/opc/nosql/kv-22.1.12
export KVHOST=`hostname`

echo $KVROOT
echo $KVDATA
echo $KVHOME
echo $KVHOST
```

### Configuring the Firewall

Do not forget to configure all firewalls. To make sure your firewall works with Oracle NoSQL Database, you should set the ports 
specified by the servicerange parameter of the makebootconfig command. This parameter is used to constrain a store to a limited 
set of ports, usually for security or data center policy reasons. By default the services use anonymous ports. 

For demo purpose, I will stop the firewall in all my servers.

````
# Use the appropiate command, in my case I am using 5.4.17-2102.200.13.el7uek.x86_64 
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
````

## Deploy your cluster

We will deploy our cluster in multiple steps in order to illustrate most popular scenarios :
1) Create minimal store (1x1) - 1 server - for test only not for production that requires high availability and business continuity
2) Increase availability (1x3) - deployed on 3 servers but only 1 shard - increase the replication factor from 1 to 3 for high availability and business continuity
3) Elastic Expansion and Rebalancing (3x3) - 3 disks on 3 servers - increase the capacity and rebalance the cluster using the new 3 shards


In our case, we will use the following scripts for each scenario
1) [config1x1.kvs](./script/config1x1.kvs)
2) [config1x3.kvs](./script/config1x3.kvs) 
3) [config3x3.kvs](./script/config3x3.kvs) 

```
java -jar $KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar runadmin -port 5000 -host node1-nosql load -file config1x1.kvs
```
![Working](1x1.PNG)
```
java -jar $KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar runadmin -port 5000 -host node1-nosql load -file config1x3.kvs
```
![Working](1x3.PNG)
```
java -jar $KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar runadmin -port 5000 -host node1-nosql load -file config3x3.kvs
```
![Working](3x3.PNG)

## Validate your deployment

```
java -jar $KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar ping  -port 5000 -host node1-nosql
```

## Fill the store with different tables
```
cd $KVHOME
javac -cp examples:lib/kvclient.jar examples/hadoop/table/LoadVehicleTable.java
java -classpath lib/kvclient.jar:examples   hadoop.table.LoadVehicleTable  -store OUG -host node1-nosql -port 5000 -nops 1000
```

## Running the http proxy and test using the github project demo graphql

```
cd $KVHOME
nohup kv_proxy &

```
